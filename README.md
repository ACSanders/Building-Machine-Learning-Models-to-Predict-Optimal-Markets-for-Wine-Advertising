## Business Situation and Questions 
A winery wants to expand into new international markets. The winery will want to determine which markets have a good amount of wine drinkers. This will help direct its distribution efforts. Moreover, it will enable them to develop effective advertising campaigns.

**The Business Questions:** Can we construct a model that predicts the amount of wine people drink in a given country based on certain econcomic and social factors?
If so, then how reliable is this model?
